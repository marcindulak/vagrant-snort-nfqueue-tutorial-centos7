# Description

An example of `snort++` (https://www.snort.org/snort3) network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (ID/IPS) deployed on an endpoint Apache host.

The setup combines Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com) with Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/) in order to
achieve a "reproducible", executable documentation in the spirit of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming
